Why Go??
 1 Infastructure changed a lot
   - Multicore processors
   - cloud infrastructure
   - Big Network Computation Clusters

2 More scalable and distributed
3 Dynamic
4 More Capacity

5 Multi-concurrency support

Solved the challenges of Mult-Threading - Concurrency > Dealing with lots of thins at once
  
  - Developers need to write code to prevent conflicts

Some languages with built-in Concurrency mechanism
 - C++
 - Java
 - Go

No built-in concurrency mechanism
 - Python
 - Node
 - Js
