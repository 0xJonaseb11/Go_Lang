## Getting started

It is a programming language that was developed at Google in 2007 and open sourced in 2009

Why Go??
 1 Infastructure changed a lot

- Multicore processors
- cloud infrastructure
- Big Network Computation Clusters

2 More scalable and distributed
3 Dynamic
4 More Capacity

5 Multi-concurrency support

Solved the challenges of Mult-Threading - Concurrency > Dealing with lots of thins at once
  
- Developers need to write code to prevent conflicts

Some languages with built-in Concurrency mechanism

- C++
- Java
- Go

No built-in concurrency mechanism

- Python
- Node
- Js

** In C++ && Java

- complex code
- Expensive & slow

- Only GO
  - Designed to run on multiple cores and built to suppoort concurrency
  - Concurrency in GO is cheap and easy
  
Main use case of GO

- For performant applications
- Rinning on scaled, distibuted systems

GO LANGUAGE FEATURES

- Server-side or backend language
  - Micro-services
  - Web applications
  - Databases services

- Simple syntax : Easy to learn, read and write code : Easy to maintatin over time

- Fast build time, start up and run
- Require fewer resources
- Compiled language
  - Compiles into single binary(machine code) that can be easliy deployed and interacted with easily by the computer
  - Consistent across different OS

### Gettin started

#### Intro to Setup , syntax and concepts

- imports
- packages
- add module requirements and sums

To get started,

 ```sh
 go mod init
 ```

To add modules requirements and sums

```sh
go mod tidy
->go:finding module for package rsc.io/quote
->go:found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote <version>
```

Run the code to see the message generated by the function u're calling,

```sh
go run <pakage_name>
# *Please don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating
```

- Go programming support integer types that include -:
`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32` and `int64`

- Machine dependent types like `uint`, `int` and `uintptr`

- Go has 2 floating point types. ie `float32`(single precision) and `float64`(double precision) as well as two additional types for representing complex numbers - `complex64` and `complex128`

`Concurrency`

_**Go has a rich support for concurrency with the use of goroutines and channels**_

`Goroutines`

A Goroutine is a function that is capable of running concurrently with other functions.
_To create a goroutine, we use `go` keyword followed by a function invocation._

- Goroutines are lightweight and we can easily create
thousands of them

`Channels`

Channels provides a way for two goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

_Normally channels are synchronous; both sides of the
channel will wait until the other side is ready. A
buffered channel is asynchronous; sending or receiving
a message will not wait unless the channel is already
full._

`<-` is used to send and receive messages on a channel
`chan` is a keyword used to represent channel - it is followed by the things we want to pass to the channel

`c <- "ping" means send "ping"`

`'msg := <- c' means receive a message and store it in 'msg'`

**`select`**
Go has a special statement `select` that works like switch but for channels

`Packages`

Inside packages, functions are started with a capital letter. This is to tell that other packages are able to see it.
