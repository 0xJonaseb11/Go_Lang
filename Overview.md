### Getting started
It is a programming language that was developed at Google in 2007 and open sourced in 2009

Why Go??
 1 Infastructure changed a lot
   - Multicore processors
   - cloud infrastructure
   - Big Network Computation Clusters

2 More scalable and distributed
3 Dynamic
4 More Capacity

5 Multi-concurrency support

Solved the challenges of Mult-Threading - Concurrency > Dealing with lots of thins at once
  
  - Developers need to write code to prevent conflicts

Some languages with built-in Concurrency mechanism
 - C++
 - Java
 - Go

No built-in concurrency mechanism
 - Python
 - Node
 - Js

** In C++ && Java
  - complex code
  - Expensive & slow

* Only GO 
  - Designed to run on multiple cores and built to suppoort concurrency
  - Concurrency in GO is cheap and easy
  
Main use case of GO
 - For performant applications
 - Rinning on scaled, distibuted systems


GO LANGUAGE FEATURES
 - Server-side or backend language
   * Micro-services
   * Web applications
   * Databases services


 - Simple syntax : Easy to learn, read and write code : Easy to maintatin over time

 - Fast build time, start up and run
 - Require fewer resources
 - Compiled language    
   * Compiles into single binary(machine code) that can be easliy deployed and interacted with easily by the computer
   * Consistent across different OS

### Gettin started

#### Intro to Setup , syntax and concepts
 - imports
 - packages
 - add module requirements and sums


To get started, 
 ```sh
 go mod init
 ```

To add
